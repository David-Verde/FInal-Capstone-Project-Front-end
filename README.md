## About The Project:
This is the final capstone project for the Full Stack Developer Program at Microverse.

The Home Sharing App is a fully responsive app that provides the service for connecting homeowners wanting to rent their properties and potential clients, enabling the creation of reservations for periods of time on selected properties.

The property owners can customize the terms of the rental for each property, which lets the app be used for short-term rental (like short vacations at the beach) or for long-term, enabling the app to point to different market segments.

The app was built with a Ruby on Rails backend and a React/Redux frontend, located on separate repositories.

This is the Frontend repository. Below you will find the link to visit the backend repo.
